This is a showcase of my skills creating a website using HTML/CSS/JS/TS

3/24: With the help of Bootstrap I quickly created a template to get started and seperate my HTML/CSS/JS
I also created the repository link on GitHub/about to upload the cloned progress to the site
I usually always upload my repository through the terminal itself but I decided to try something new 
Initially I created the repository first through the website itself but realized that in order to publish to GitHub through VSC I needed to recreate the repository here 

Afterwards I had to figure out how to link my first project from the file itself to the Portfolio
I was able to make a copy of the code and add it as a link (href) to be seen as a second page to my Portfolio
When I complete my other future projects, I will add them in as well as a constant update
