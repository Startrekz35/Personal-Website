This is a showcase of my skills creating a website using HTML/CSS/JS

3/24: With the help of Bootstrap I quickly created a template to get started and seperate my HTML/CSS/JS
I also created the repository link on GitHub/about to upload the cloned progress to the site
I usually always upload my repository through the terminal itself but I decided to try something new 
Initially I created the repository first through the website itself but realized that in order to publish to GitHub through VSC I needed to recreate the repository here
