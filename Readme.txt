This is a showcase of my skills creating a website using HTML/CSS/JS/TS

3/24-3/29: With the help of Bootstrap I quickly created a template to get started and seperate my HTML/CSS/JS
I also created the repository link on GitHub/about to upload the cloned progress to the site
I usually always upload my repository through the terminal itself but I decided to try something new 
Initially I created the repository first through the website itself but realized that in order to publish to GitHub through VSC I needed to recreate the repository here 

Afterwards I had to figure out how to link my first project from the file itself to the Portfolio
I was able to make a copy of the code and add it as a link (href) to be seen as a second page to my Portfolio
When I complete my other future projects, I will add them in as well as a constant update

3/31: So a big overhaul happened to the site
I redesigned the template of the site and started reorganizing the source website and creating hyperlinks
I uploaded to GitHub Pages but I was getting a 404 error so I had to troubleshoot and figure out why it wasn't linking to my html file
The answer was I wasn't organized enough and decided to put some things into folders and have only the base index.html file as what was recognized in the page
That meant hyperlinks had to be recreated and relinked
I still have more to go but at least this website is finally online and linked to my very first project
Although the base site is mobile friendly the google homepage is not so I'll have to figure out how to restructure it
Good news is that I hyperlinked the page to my github profile so people can see the source code as well

4/1: I started up my About me page and had to go through more trial and error to make it how I like
At the same time I noticed that the navbar only highlighted the Home page no matter what page I currently was on
I couldn't remember how the current page was hightlighted without a script so I looked at the previous commit
The commit that had the huge overhaul in the layout of the code was where I noticed that the class="active" was hovered over the word: Home
I then changed the class="active" based on which ever page I was currently on
On the About Page I had to change the text color to contrast the background image 

The toughest part about creating a Portfolio website that teaches you in the process and showcases your skills is that you have to make sure that the website has not only Browser Compatibility but also Mobile Compatibility

4/4: In the meantime while I build this website I'm going to continue to learn more JavaScript so I can understand what I code

4/5: I will be completely remaking my Google Homepage Project today
I'm making my contact me page but realize that once again I'll have to reorganize and hyperlink ALL of my pages
Funny thing is I already started applying to jobs since I really have nothing to lose so I need to re-link everything NOW
