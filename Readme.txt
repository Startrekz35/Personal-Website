This is a showcase of my skills creating a website using HTML/CSS/JS/TS

3/24-3/29: With the help of Bootstrap I quickly created a template to get started and seperate my HTML/CSS/JS
I also created the repository link on GitHub/about to upload the cloned progress to the site
I usually always upload my repository through the terminal itself but I decided to try something new 
Initially I created the repository first through the website itself but realized that in order to publish to GitHub through VSC I needed to recreate the repository here 

Afterwards I had to figure out how to link my first project from the file itself to the Portfolio
I was able to make a copy of the code and add it as a link (href) to be seen as a second page to my Portfolio
When I complete my other future projects, I will add them in as well as a constant update

3/31: So a big overhaul happened to the site
I redesigned the template of the site and started reorganizing the source website and creating hyperlinks
I uploaded to GitHub Pages but I was getting a 404 error so I had to troubleshoot and figure out why it wasn't linking to my html file
The answer was I wasn't organized enough and decided to put some things into folders and have only the base index.html file as what was recognized in the page
That meant hyperlinks had to be recreated and relinked
I still have more to go but at least this website is finally online and linked to my very first project
Although the base site is mobile friendly the google homepage is not so I'll have to figure out how to restructure it
Good news is that I hyperlinked the page to my github profile so people can see the source code as well
